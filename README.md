The course provides a practical introduction to Software Engineering. Students work on an open problem that is defined by stakeholders outside of the students' team. That means that students will not be able to define the project they work on themselves. In order to address this challenge, students will learn:
* a software development process to structure their work
* how to specify and evaluate requirements and the collaboration with stakeholders to assure that was is being delivered is perceived as valuable
* new technologies and tools and fitting ways to use them in order to realise the value proposition based on the students' own learning strategies
* how to organise themselves in a team in order to reach a joint goal with limited resources
* how to reflect on their own work and learning to enable a continuous improvement of their way of working
